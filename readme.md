The memory game is a fun, easy game that tests your memory.  To begin click on two cards to see if they match.  Do your best to remember the placement of these cards as the goal is to match up all the pairs of images on the other side.  If a match is not found the cards will be flipped face down again and you must select two more cards.  Whem a match is found the cards will stay face up and will be unable to be selected again.  Once all the cards are matched you have completed the game and will be asked if you'd like to play again.
